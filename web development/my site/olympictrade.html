        <p>2.4. Bonus: virtual funds credited by the Company to the Client’s Account when the Client meets the conditions
            established by the Company. When the Client makes trades, the funds deposited by the Client are used first, and only

            general rule, the Client may not withdraw the Bonus to a Client's External Account. In the event the Client
            withdraws previously deposited funds to the Client's External Account, the Company has the right to deduct the full
            sum of the previously accrued Bonuses from the Client’s Account. The Company has the right to set a minimum trade
            volume, as well as other conditions under which the Bonus is not deducted from the Client’s Account and may be

            the Agreement), or receives a refund of the Trade Amount (if the Client does not fulfill the payout conditions
            established in the Clause 2.3. of this Agreement). When the Client uses a risk-free trade that resulted in the
            return of the Trade Amount to the Client (because the target and asset price were equal when the Fixed Time Trade
            expired), the risk free trade offer is considered to be used by the Client.</p>

        <p>2.10. Income: the amount of money that is determined and added to the Client's Account at the time of Closing of a
            Trade. The amount of Income is determined by the essential conditions of the trade and the Asset Rate. Income is
            deposited to the Client’s account from the Company’s guaranteed (compensatory, special) fund (reserves), which is
            formed in the manner determined by the Company at its own expense.</p>
        <p>2.11. Making of a Trade: a transaction as a result of which the essential conditions of a trade with derivative
            financial instruments are agreed between the Client and the Company. After the Trade is made and the trade
            settlement is transferred to the liquidity provider, a Fixed Time Trade is considered to be opened.
        </p>
        <p>2.12. Closing of a Trade: a transaction in which an open trade is closed upon the Fixed Time Trade Expiration Time

                provided to the Company under the Agreement and its appendices, and for damages caused to the Company because of
                any
                misstatement contained in the documents provided by the Client;</li>
            <li>b) damages caused to the Company because of the abuse of the Company’s services provided to the Client, including

                software tools and other tools, devices, methods, and techniques that facilitate or contribute to the violation
                of
                the principle of integrity, honesty and fairness in the execution of transactions;</li>
            <li>c) damages caused by the Client as a result of actions, coordinated with the other Company’s Clients and/or
                affiliates of the Client, aimed at causing losses to the Company; for other damages caused to the Company by the
                Client by using the other unfair and dishonest methods and techniques for making trades (executing transactions)
                with the Company, including the usage of bonuses. In any event, “the Client’s affiliates” refers to any of the
                following persons with regard to their relationship with the Client: those in a kinship relationship of any
                degree,
                family members, partners, or other relations, those residing at the same address, those using the same devices,
                those engaged as the Company’s Clients by the same partner or the Client of the Company, and those engaged in
                any
                collective activity with or without the formation of a legal entity. The Company reserves the right to expand
                the
                list of situations and attributes based upon which the Client and third parties may be recognized as
                affiliates.</li>
            <li>d) if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the Client attempted to illegally use the software provided by
                the
                Company and the funds transferred to the Company’s account;</li>
            <li>e) damages caused to the Company as a result of deriving income from the use of the technical features of the
                quote-feed updating system in the Trading Terminal, and deriving income from the use of the software errors and
                vulnerabilities in the Trading Terminal;</li>
            <li>f) damages caused to the Company by the Client’s use of insider, confidential, or other information whereby the
                Client was provided with any kind of advantages in making trades with the Company.</li>
            <li>The Company has the right to deduct the aforesaid damages from the Client’s account and/or the accounts of other
                persons (if it is established that these accounts belong to the Client (or the Client’s accomplices) by means of
                the
                Company’s technical and other equipment and tools). The Company also has the right to block further transactions
                in
                the Trading Terminal and the personal area to the Clients with respect to whom the Company has sufficient
                grounds
                and suspicions to classify their actions (including collective actions with other Clients) as aimed at causing
                damages to the Company, and to transfer funds from the Client’s account to the Company’s one.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>8.4. If the Client violates the Agreement, the Company reserves the right, at its own discretion, to:</p>
        <p>8.4.1. revise the amount of the Company’s financial obligations to the Client and amend the data (balance) of the
            Client’s Account;</p>
        <p>8.4.2. suspend the provision of the services to the Client and block access to the Trading Terminal. If the Company
            blocks the Client’s access to the Trading Terminal, the Client is obliged to take all necessary and reasonable steps
            to remedy the reasons for blocking access to the Trading Terminal. If the Client does not take any measures or
            actions to remedy the mentioned reasons within thirty (30) days, the Company reserves the right to deduct all the
            funds from the trading account. The Company reserves the right but is not obligated to recover all the deducted
            funds back into the Client’s trading account if the Client satisfies all the requirements needed to lift the block
            on their trading account.</p>
        <p>8.5. If the Client violates any terms of the Agreement and its integral parts listed in Cl. 1.2., including the
            refusal to undergo the necessary checks and provide the necessary information, the Company has the right to
            repudiate the Agreement, to void any Client’s transaction, to close one, several, or all the Client’s trades at any
            time at its discretion, and stop rendering the services to the Client, returning or without returning the funds to
            the Client at its own discretion. Any violation of the terms listed in this clause deprives the Client of the right
            to demand a payment or a refund from the Company.</p>
        <p>8.5.1. If the Company has repudiated the Agreement with the Client for the violation of the terms of the Agreement,
            the Client has no right to open a new account, including by entering third party’s data during registration. If the
            Company reveals the Client’s violation specified in this clause, the consequences stipulated in Cl. 8.5. of the
            Agreement follow.</p>
        <p>8.6. The Company is not responsible to the Client for any damages, losses, lost profit, missed opportunities
            (including, but not limited to, due to possible market fluctuations), expenses, or detriment incurred by the Client
            as a result of making trades pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.</p>
        <p>8.7. The Company is not responsible in the event of a discrepancy between the information displayed in the Client’s
            Trading Terminal and the information on the Company’s server in the process of defining the financial result of the
            Client’s trades. To resolve such discrepancy, the Company will adjust the data in the Trading Terminal in accordance
            with the information available on the Company’s server.</p>
        <p>8.8. The Company is not responsible for the Client’s damages if such damages resulted from hacker attacks, accidents
            in (malfunctions of) computer networks, communication networks, power lines, and/or telecommunication systems, etc.
            directly used to agree on the essential conditions of the Client’s transactions or ensure other Company’s operating
            procedures that occurred through no fault of the Company.</p>
        <p>8.9. The Company is not responsible for technical failures and/or interruptions in the Trading Terminal’s operation
            that occurred as a result of hacker attacks, accidents in (malfunctions of) computer networks, communication
            networks, power lines, and/or telecommunication systems, etc., and for the Client’s damages resulting from such
            malfunctions and/or interruptions.</p>
        <p>8.10. The Company is not responsible for the results of transactions that the Client decided to make on the basis of
            analytical materials provided by the Company and/or third parties. The Client has been informed that transactions
            made in accordance with the Agreement bear the risk of not receiving the expected income and the risk of loss of
            some or all of the money deposited in his/her Client’s Account. The Client acknowledges that unless there is fraud,
            a deliberate breach of obligations, or gross negligence on the part of the Company, the Company is not responsible
            for any losses, expenses, costs and damages of the Client resulting from the inaccuracy of information provided to
            the Client, including, but not limited to, information about the Client’s trading transactions. The Company reserves
            the right to cancel or close any Client’s transaction under the conditions established in the Agreement. However,
            all transactions executed by the Client as a result of inaccurate information or error remain valid and must be
            fulfilled by both the Client and the Company.</p>
        <p>8.11. The Company is not responsible for any losses the Client may incur in the event of a theft, loss, or disclosure
            of their Trading Terminal password to third parties. The Client assumes full responsibility for protecting his/her
            password and safeguarding it against unauthorized third-party access.</p>
        <p>8.12. The Company is not responsible for breach (improper fulfillment) of its obligations specified in the Agreement
            if such breach was caused by force majeure events or other exceptional situations stated in the Agreement or
            its appendices.</p>
        <p>8.13. The Company is not responsible for any indirect, special, arbitrary, or punitive damages incurred by the
            Client, including, but not limited to, lost profit, loss of expected savings, or loss of income, even if the Client
            was informed by the Company about the possibility of such damages. Non-pecuniary damage is not compensated.</p>
        <p>8.14. The Company reserves the right to consider the Client’s breaches at any time, regardless of when the breach
            took place, and if the breaches are discovered by the Company, to take measures in accordance with the
            Agreement.</p>

        <h3>10. Final Provisions</h3>

            aforementioned documents.</p>
        <p>10.3. When amendments and addenda made by the Company enter into force, they will apply equally to all the Clients,
            including those who entered into the Agreement before the effective date of such amendment and addenda. </p>
        <p>10.4. To ensure that the Client who entered into the Agreement is aware of all the amendments and addenda to the

            the authorized persons at least once a week to find information about the amendments and/or addenda.</p>
        <p>10.5. When providing his/her personal data to the Company in any form and in any way (when performing any actions on
            the Company’s website, through the Company’s counterparties, etc.), the Client (natural person) thereby gives the

            with the current legislation of the Company’s principal place of business). The consent is to be withdrawn in

            Company guarantees the confidentiality of the personal data provided by the Client, excluding the circumstances

        <p>10.6. The Client has the right to use information that was provided to the Client either orally or in writing, posted
            by the Company or by third parties, and access to which was granted to him/her as a part of the services specified
            in the Agreement only for the transactions specified in the Agreement. The Client does not have the right to
            disseminate, alter, or supplement the aforementioned information, or store it in separate archives. In any event,
            the scope of authority granted to the Client with respect to the information posted by third parties cannot exceed
            the scope of authority obtained by the Company from the third party. The Company does not guarantee that the
            information posted by third parties is reliable, accurate, relevant, or will be provided on an ongoing basis without
            any interruptions.</p>
        <p>The Company is not responsible for the results of transactions (losses, lost profit, lost income, reputation damages,
            etc.) that the Client executed on the basis of information that was communicated to the Client either orally or in
            writing by the Company or third parties.</p>
        <p>10.7. The Company may fully or partially transfer their rights and obligations specified in the Agreement and its
            appendices to a third party if such party undertakes to fulfill the terms of the Agreement. This transfer of rights
            and obligations does not require prior notification to the Client by the Company and is considered to be made at the
            time the information is published on the Company’s website.</p>
        <p>10.8. The Client is not entitled to assign his/her own rights, transfer his/her own obligations or dispose of the
            rights or obligations specified in the Agreement in any other way without the prior written consent of the Company.

        <p>10.9. The Company, its partners, or any other affiliates may have material gain, legal relation, or arrangement with
            respect to any transaction on the trading platform or in the personal area, or a material gain, legal relation, or
            arrangement that is in conflict with the Client’s interests. For example, the Company may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a) act as a counterparty concerning any asset;</li>
            <li>b) suggest another partner of the Company as a counterparty for a trading transaction;</li>
            <li>c) give recommendations and render services to its partners or other clients of the Company with respect to the
                assets in which they have a stake, despite the fact that this is in conflict with the Client’s interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>10.10. The Client agrees and authorizes the Company to act with respect to the Client and for the Client as the
            Company finds appropriate, despite the potential conflicts of interest or the existence of some material interest in
            relation to any transaction in the Trading Terminal or in the personal area without prior notification of the
            Client. The existence of a conflict of interest or material gain with respect to any transaction in the Trading
            Terminal or in the personal area must not affect the provision of services to the Client by the Company’s employees.
            The Company has the right to occasionally act on behalf of the Client with parties with whom the Company or any of
            its related parties have an agreement to receive goods or services. The Company guarantees that these agreements are
            made as far as possible for the benefit of the Client, for example, such agreements make it possible to access
            information and other services that would otherwise be inaccessible.</p>
        <p>10.11. If a court of proper jurisdiction declares any provision of the Agreement (or any part of any provision) null
            and void, such provision will be treated as a separate part of the Agreement, and the remainder of this Agreement
            will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>10.12. The Company has the right to suspend the services’ provision to the Client at any time (prior notice to the
            Client is not required).</p>
        <p>10.13. In situations not described in the Agreement, the Company will act according to the accepted business
            practices based on principles of honesty and fairness.</p>
        <p>10.14. The Company reserves the right to prepare and use the text of the Agreement and its appendices in languages
            other than English. If there are contradictions between the text of the Agreement and its appendices in English with
            the corresponding texts in other languages, the text in English will prevail. The text of the Agreement published on
            the Company's website prevails over the text of the Agreement published elsewhere.</p>
        <p>10.15. The Client is granted a limited and non-exclusive right to use the Trading Terminal only for the purposes
            specified in the Agreement. In this case, if the Agreement is terminated/repudiated for any reason, the Client’s
            rights to use the Trading Terminal specified in this Clause will be terminated upon the termination/repudiation of
            the Agreement.</p>
        <p>10.16. The Client agrees that the Company cannot guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, and technically sound operation
            of the Trading Terminal, and therefore the Client accepts this software as is. The Company is not responsible to the
            Client for malfunctions in the Trading Terminal.</p>
        <p>10.17. All the definitions used in the Agreement and its integral parts have the same meaning irrespective of whether
            they are in upper case or lower case, unless otherwise follows from the nature of the obligation.</p>
